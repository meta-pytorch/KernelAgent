# Utils

This directory hosts utility code used by the various agents in the repository.

The guideline for code in this directory:
- It should be reusable across multiple agents; it should not contain agent-specific logic
- It should not take a dependency on any other directory in the repository
- It should be "boring" (i.e. not contain any novel or interesting logic)
