"""Host-side fast-launch helpers for CuTeDSL pointer entrypoints.

CuTeDSL's Python runtime typically marshals each kernel call by allocating
`Int32` / `Float32` wrappers and runtime `Pointer` descriptors per invocation.
For latency-sensitive cases (small/medium M), this overhead can dominate.

These helpers provide:
- Stable scalar argument wrappers (`StableI32Arg`, `StableF32Arg`) that avoid
  per-call ctypes allocations.
- In-place mutation of runtime pointer descriptors (`set_runtime_ptr`) so a
  compiled kernel can be launched repeatedly with different raw device pointers
  without rebuilding argument objects.
- A small thread-local cache to store packed args objects (when supported by the
  installed CuTeDSL version).

All of this relies on a few private-ish CuTeDSL internals. Callers must treat
fast-launch as an optional optimization and fall back to the normal launch
path if those internals are unavailable.
